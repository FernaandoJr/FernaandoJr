<h2 align="left">📌 About Me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
Since I was very young, I've always been passionate about the internet and technology. As the years went by, this passion only grew stronger, and it became clear that I would pursue a career in a tech-related field.
I took a technical high school course called Software Development, where I had my first real experience with coding and building projects. That was when I realized that what truly excites me is creating things—bringing ideas from my mind into the real world, whether through programming or other creative processes.
Web technologies were my first gateway: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript helped me understand the fundamentals of logic and algorithms. From there, I decided to fully dive into the web development world, where the possibilities are endless—inside or even beyond the browser—building APIs, services, and even games.
Today, I dedicate my time and energy to continuously improving my skills in modern technologies, frameworks, and platforms demanded by the industry. I love creating personal projects and collaborating with other developers who share the same passion for technology and innovation.
