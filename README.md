<h2 align="left">ðŸ“Œ About Me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
From a young age, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the internet and technology. Over time, this interest evolved into a clear passion for creating not just through code, but by bringing ideas to life.

I studied Software Development in a technical high school program, where I realized how much I enjoy building real-world solutions. My journey began with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which helped me grasp the fundamentals of logic and development.

Since then, Iâ€™ve focused on web development, exploring everything from APIs to full-stack apps. Today, I dedicate myself to improving my skills in modern tools, frameworks, and real-world projects both personal and collaborative.

<h2 align="left">ðŸ§  Personal Interests</h2>

<p align="left">
I've always been curious about how things work on the web, and that curiosity quickly turned into a real passion. I love working with JavaScript and TypeScript, and Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into tools like React, Next.js, and Node.js. I enjoy building things from scratch, experimenting with new tech, and learning how to make web experiences faster, smarter, and more fun to use.
